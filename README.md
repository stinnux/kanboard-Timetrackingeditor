==================


## Important Notice

I am no longer using Kanboard, therefore i will no longer maintain or support the Timetrackingeditor. It would be great if someone is interested in volunteering to maintain the project in the future.

Requirements
------------

- Kanboard >= 1.0.38 (not testet with older versions)


Installation
------------

You have the choice between 3 methods:

1. Install the plugin from the Kanboard plugin manager in one click
2. Download the zip file and decompress everything under the directory `plugins/Timetrackingeditor`
3. Clone this repository into the folder `plugins/Timetrackingeditor`

Note: Plugin folder is case-sensitive.


Documentation
-------------

With this plugin you are able to edit, remove and manually create entries in the Time Tracking Table. 

Just go to a subtask, select "Time Tracking" (only visible if you have entered either an estimate and/or time spent value for the Task). Now you have the opportunity to add/remove/delete entries. You are only allowed to remove and edit your own entries.

You can also add comments to every Time Tracking entry and select if the time is billable or not. Entries that have been selected as billable have a shopping cart symbol. 

Additionally you can export all time tracking entries as an HTML table (which makes it easy to import to excel) using the command ``` kanboard export:allsubtaskstimetracking```
